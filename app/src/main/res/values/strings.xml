    <string name="welcome_text" formatted="false">BlabberTabber allows you to record how much time each
        speaker has spoken in a meeting.\n
        \nTo pause, press "PAUSE", to resume, press
        "RECORD", and to reset the tally, press "RESET".\n

    <string name="acknowledgements_text" formatted="false">BlabberTabber was written
        by Brendan Cunnie and Brian Cunnie.\n
        \nCharlotte Cunningham designed the UI and created the graphics.\n
        \nDaniel Di Matteo wrote the first android diarization program. His code
        helped us tremendously, and uses LIUM.\n
        \nLIUM is a Java-based open source toolkit for diarization, written by
        Sylvain Meignier, Gregor Dupuy, Paul Gay, and others. It uses Sphinx.\n
        \nCMU Sphinx is open source toolkit for speech recognition.\n
        \nGerald Friedland, Ph.D. and Ekaterina Gonina, Ph.D. advised us and
        published the research papers which inspired us to write BlabberTabber.
